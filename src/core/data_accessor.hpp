 * @brief A base class for data accessing: on DBs and Transactions state.

 * @section Keys.
 * The key type is set to a 64-bit unsigned integer.
 * Todays engines often support string keys of variable length,
 * but generally work faster if keys are of identical length.
 * To avoid extra heap allocations and expensive integer formatting,
 * under the hood, we pass a view to raw bytes forming the integer key.
 * For order consistency it's also recommended to provide a custom
 * comparator.
 * @section Values.
 * The Value buffer can be bigger than actual value because of memory alignment
 * Note: This is done for read workloads only
